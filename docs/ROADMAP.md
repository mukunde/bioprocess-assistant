# Roadmap: evidence-grounded bioprocess assistance

## Direction

Keep Neo4j as the published knowledge store. Add a separate PDF ingestion job,
review extracted claims before publication, and measure both answer quality and
cost. Adopt useful KAG principles incrementally; do not migrate to OpenSPG yet.
The reliability baseline is implemented. Ingestion/review and local passage
retrieval have been exercised on selected real-manual examples; the reviewed
knowledge is not yet served by the chatbot. Portable telemetry, independent
answer evaluation and the common-corpus retrieval comparison remain pending.
See [the ingestion guide](INGESTION.md) for the separate local pipeline.

2026-10-19 extraction decision: provisionally retain GPT-6.1 Sol (medium) for rare
strong-model extraction. Claim contract v0.2 and per-claim quarantine are implemented. The earlier-prompt
100–102 package remains archived. The local `pages-100-102-v02-r2` package is
reviewed after one subscription generation on 59 source elements: 33 final claims,
19 validated and 14 validated with reservations (20 October 2026). See the
[curated review package](../experiments/cytiva/reviewed-r2/README.md).
Publication, scientific validation and migration into the existing UI remain pending.
The 97–99 comparison remains a development result, not a general model ranking.
Migration from the legacy dense template/review database is still pending.

## Agreed constraints and current state

- Prioritize troubleshooting: symptoms, possible causes and actions. Demonstrate
  both AI/LLM engineering and data/knowledge engineering.
- Budget below EUR 10/month; local processing by default. Subscription-interface
  experiments on the public manual are explicitly authorized. No API purchase is
  implied. The user is available during weekdays; there is no global five-hour
  weekly limit.
- The user can verify documentary fidelity without an external domain expert.
  Operational suitability is a separate claim and is not established here.
- The local Ministral dense extraction produced 29 entities and no semantic
  relations in approximately 56 minutes. The subscription comparison on pages
  97–99 led to provisional selection of GPT-6.1 Sol; see
  [the fidelity review](experiments/cytiva-v01-fidelity.md).
- Contract v0.2 separates purpose/conditions, force, quantities and source
  quarantine. The archived 100–102 package contains 59 Docling items from the earlier prompt;
  it is unexecuted. The corrected-prompt `pages-100-102-v02-r2` package has completed
  generation and per-claim human documentary review (33 final claims, none pending).
  This development review is not an exhaustive gold benchmark or a causal retrieval
  evaluation. Reviewed cleaning and contaminant sources/questions now extend the
  procedural sample; their retrieval results are summarized below. Next: preserve
  decisions/reservations in the serving adapter and measure coverage independently.
- The earlier [methodology review](decisions/2026-10-roadmap-review.md) is an
  archive of the reasoning, not a second plan to maintain.

## Current checkpoint — 24 October 2026

Phase numbers below identify workstreams and acceptance gates, not a claim that
all earlier phases have passed. Documentary experiments advanced before the
planned telemetry layer; local manifests/timings do not satisfy phase 1.

| Workstream | Implemented or reviewed | Remaining gate |
|---|---|---|
| 0 — Reliability | Constrained rendering, error handling, additive graph loading and offline regressions | Live end-to-end deployment evaluation remains separate |
| 1 — Observability | Reproducible experiment manifests, context/token accounting and local timings | OpenTelemetry workflows, portable export, call/retry/cost accounting and enforcement |
| 2 — Model and references | Minimal ontology, v0.2 claim contract, 33 reviewed extraction claims and reviewed Q/N/C, H and V question series | Local W01-W12 await review; exhaustive omission/causal coverage and independent answer evaluation remain open; documentary approval is not scientific validation |
| 3 — Ingestion and chunking | Local Docling Graph route; separate Docling → GPT-6.1 Sol experiment; selected table/figure reviews and repairs | Real-manual extraction precision/recall, full ingestion lifecycle and migration into serving |
| 4 — Retrieval | Local BM25, atomic dependencies, frozen v03b failures and opt-in v04 development A-D are merged; W preparation is local only | Review and run frozen W without tuning; reviewed-record serving adapter, actual answers/abstentions, independent evaluation and common-corpus comparison remain open |
| 5 — KAG decision | Deferred | A concrete need beyond simpler retrieval and bounded reasoning |

The merged checkpoint is `main` at `081a30d`, after
[PR #34](https://github.com/mukunde/bioprocess-assistant/pull/34) (frozen v03b review/results)
and [PR #35](https://github.com/mukunde/bioprocess-assistant/pull/35) (v04 development,
selected A-D results and maintained-suite correction). **433/433 tests passed on
that merged checkpoint**, with zero skipped tests. These counts use existing local
dependency environments; they are regression results, not answer quality or a
fresh-install certification. Earlier checkpoints and counts remain historical in
their reports and [the consolidation record](CONSOLIDATION.md).

**Local working state, not merged:** the eight-file W preparation adds twelve
bilingual question/reference intents and thirteen integrity/synthetic harness
checks. The complete local suite passes **446/446**, but no real W question has
been searched, planned, assembled or scored. All twelve references await human
review; there is no human-review record or locked-run output. A fresh clone of
the merged checkpoint has neither this packet nor its thirteen new checks.

The local paths are `experiments/cytiva/v04-evaluation-v01/` (including its
protocol), `experiments/cytiva/v04_evaluation.py` and `tests/test_v04_evaluation.py`.
They are described as local paths rather than published links because they are
not part of the merged repository at this checkpoint.

### Next delivery priorities

1. **Review W01-W12 and measure frozen v04 once.** The method lock already binds
   the unchanged v04 code/configuration before question/reference JSON. Review
   exact excerpts, required/acceptable and unrequested sources, expected answers,
   reservations and diagnostic criteria, then explicitly authorize the single
   run. The predeclared gate requires all twelve intents complete in both
   languages, no explicitly unrequested source, no failed reference diagnostic
   and no hard invariant violation. Preserve all contexts, errors and incomplete
   cases. Do not tune after opening results or silently retry; a fix creates a
   new development variant and needs another prospective set. Use W as a decision
   point rather than extending known-case tuning indefinitely. A pass permits
   considering a limited end-to-end pilot, not automatic adoption.
2. **Build a useful complete slice.** Map a small approved corpus into eligible
   v0.2 claims and the shared renderer. This reviewed-record serving adapter is
   still missing. Retain source snapshots, conditions, reservations and quarantine;
   exercise clarification/refusal, activation, correction, revocation and rollback
   without silently expanding legacy-seed coverage. Mark source-only context where
   no approved claim exists. Adapter development does not imply that a blocked
   retrieval candidate is eligible for adoption.
3. **Instrument and evaluate that path.** Add minimal OpenTelemetry spans during
   retrieval/answer integration, including versions, errors, retries and budgets;
   verify portable export and usage/cost accounting. Then evaluate actual rendered
   answers, citations and abstentions with deterministic checks, calibrated local
   Ragas and Promptfoo attacks plus benign controls. All three integrations remain
   pending; local experiment manifests and token counts do not complete them.
4. **Compare architectures after prerequisites.** Run the common-corpus
   graph/passages/LightRAG protocol with reviewed adapters, separate evaluation
   inputs and a shared resource/context budget. Benchmark a lightweight local
   answering/routing model; keep KAG and fine-tuning conditional on measured unmet
   needs. These comparisons and adoption decisions remain unexecuted.

No additional representative-page review is a prerequisite by default. Reopen
conversion/chunking when a new format, measured retrieval failure or required
source exposes a concrete gap. The optional pages 53, 86 and 142 are untested
extensions, not an automatic whole-manual review queue.

## Phase 0 — Reliability baseline (implemented; deployment gate separate)

- Reject unverified free-form model answers. The model selects retrieved result
  IDs; application code renders graph facts and their sources.
- Keep French/English headings and refusals. Technical facts remain verbatim in
  their canonical English until reviewed translations are available.
- Fail evaluations on unexpected refusals, incorrect symptom selection, missing
  verdicts and invalid judge output. Separate lexical English retrieval from the
  bilingual end-to-end contract.
- Make seed import additive, publish seed changes atomically, and wait for the
  full-text index before serving queries. Remove automatic domain-wide deletion.
- Preserve zero thresholds and reject negative/non-finite thresholds.
- Add offline regression tests; no live database or paid API needed.

Exit: offline regression tests pass. Live Neo4j/Anthropic evaluation remains a
separate required check before deployment. Historical scores are not scores of
this revised pipeline.

## Phase 1 — Portable observability (pending; next integration prerequisite)

Use a provider-neutral call wrapper with an optional Langfuse sink. Record a
trace ID, operation (chat / extraction / judge), model, prompt/schema version,
latency, status, provider request ID, attempts, and provider-reported token usage.
Separate uncached input, cache reads, cache writes and output tokens. Retain a
versioned price configuration, currency and effective date; label calculated
amounts as estimates and reconcile them with provider billing.

Do not log prompts, PDFs, credentials or user identifiers by default. Keep the
assistant working when telemetry is unavailable. Add per-run extraction budgets,
explicit retry limits and spend alerts; monitoring alone is not budget enforcement.
Instrument agent, judge and future extraction calls, not just the chat endpoint.

Exit: one trace per workflow with linked calls; successful, failed and retried
calls are accounted for; unknown pricing is reported as unknown, never zero.
Validate usage and cost accounting on fixed fixtures including cache usage.

## Phase 2 — A versioned domain model and a reference extraction set

Status: [minimal ontology](ontology/v0.1.md), [claim contract v0.2](CLAIM-CONTRACT-V02.md)
and scoped human references are implemented. The 33 extraction claims and reviewed
Q/N/C (28 intents), H (10) and V (12) series are documentary/development references
with overlapping facts. W adds twelve local pending intents. These do not establish
exhaustive extraction recall, independent authorship or a held-out answer benchmark.
The target model and acceptance gate follow;
the implemented subset is summarized above.

Add stable domain IDs independently of display names. Model Document,
DocumentVersion, Evidence (page, block/table/cell, exact quote), Claim,
Symptom, Cause, Action, Resin, ProcessStep and ApplicabilityCondition.
Capture units, ranges, negations, resin-specific restrictions and document date.
Use separate Evidence for each factual claim and each causal relationship.
Keep source statements separate from expert interpretations and inferred claims.

Curate a reference set from a few representative Cytiva pages (paragraphs,
troubleshooting tables, footnotes, scans). Have the user check documentary fidelity
against the source, including numerical recommendations; mark uncertainty rather
than assuming operational validity. Domain expertise remains a separate requirement
before an operational industrial use is claimed.

Exit: schemas, stable IDs and reference annotations reviewed; every published
claim has a traceable source and an applicability context.

## Phase 3 — Docling Graph ingestion into staging

Status: isolated local conversion/extraction/review and optional separate evidence
publication exist. The GPT-6.1 Sol subscription extraction is a distinct reviewed
route, not evidence that the local model achieves the same quality. Neither
route feeds the existing chat. End-to-end acceptance criteria below remain open.

PDF registry + SHA-256/version -> Docling conversion -> schema-constrained
Docling Graph extraction -> validation -> staging -> human review -> publication
into Neo4j. Run outside the interactive Chainlit container and pin the ingestion
runtime separately. Verify the chosen release's Python/backend compatibility.

Use Pydantic templates for domain objects, an adapter into our domain schema, and
explicit provenance validation. Docling Graph exports are not automatically our
production schema. Verify page/quote grounding on the reference set; schema-valid
JSON does not establish scientific truth. Never execute model-generated Cypher.
Use parameterized publication queries, stable IDs, content hashes and checkpoints.
Re-importing the same approved version must not duplicate or remove knowledge.

Exit: extraction precision/recall on annotated claims and relations; complete
verified provenance for published claims; rejection of unsupported numbers;
reviewed contradictions; idempotent import, resume and rollback exercised.
Measure cost per PDF/page and per approved claim, including retries/review rejects.

### Completed targeted reviews — tables, captions and diagrams

The [conversion/chunking protocol](experiments/cytiva-conversion-chunking-protocol.md)
was exercised without extraction LLMs or paid APIs on pages 77, 88, 104 and
152–153. T0/T1 conversion and K0/K800 tests preserve historical outputs; later
repairs and reviewed annotations are new artifacts. Table recognition was
**disabled in the earlier r2 extraction**, so these are separate experiments.

| Reviewed example | Completed scope | Retained limits |
|---|---|---|
| [Page 77](../experiments/cytiva/reviewed-page-077/README.md) | Ten cards: species/header scope, pH, seven remarks and observed chunk conservation | Source blanks stay blank; some applicability context is in a different chunk; no production retrieval approval |
| [Page 88](../experiments/cytiva/reviewed-page-088/README.md) | Nine cards: deterministic coordinate reconstruction, 40 cells, five notes and 12 cell-note bindings | Original available-formats conversion defect remains historical; reconstruction is specific to this table, not a general converter fix |
| [Page 104](../experiments/cytiva/reviewed-page-104/README.md) | Six cards: image/caption, five paths, alternative, applicability, VH3 and K0/K800 conservation | Reviewed paths are human readings, not extracted directed edges; automatic text-only diagram semantics remain quarantined |
| [Pages 152–153 v1](../experiments/cytiva/reviewed-pages-152-153/README.md) and [v2](../experiments/cytiva/reviewed-pages-152-153-v2/README.md) | Six initial decisions plus one v2 conservation decision: HiTrap/HiScreen repair, continuity, note scope and integrated annotations | Three ambiguous rows remain physically quarantined; no complete property-cell or production retrieval approval |

Current scoped decisions are in each package's review record. Historical pending
flags in frozen preparation artifacts stay unchanged. Reservations, source
provenance and original human quotations remain part of the accepted record.

These examples validate observed conversion/chunk conservation and documentary
readings with reservations. They do not establish automated diagram reasoning,
optimal chunk size, retrieval completeness, full-manual correctness or scientific
applicability. K600/K1400 and optional pages 53/86/142 remain untested; broadening
the matrix requires a concrete need rather than a default page-by-page review.

## Phase 4 — Contextual retrieval and bounded reasoning

### Implemented development baseline

Local BM25 retrieval and atomic context assembly use exact reviewed passages,
source dependencies, immutable run manifests and a 2,048-token serialized-context
cap. No LLM, embedding model or paid API was needed for these trials. The cap does
not include a future answer prompt or output. Earlier trials/configurations are
preserved and no experiment silently changes the chat default.

| Reference series | Observed result | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| [Q01–Q10 and N01–N08](experiments/cytiva-retrieval-depth-results.md), cleaning pp. 166–167 | Six hits preserve 10/10 Q and improve N from 7/8 to 8/8 with complete required evidence in both languages | N05's sixth-ranked passage and dependent heading are recovered; greater context size is not proven better precision |
| [C01–C10 first run](experiments/cytiva-contaminants-retrieval-results.md), contaminants pp. 118–121 | Five → six hits improves bilingual completeness from 5/10 to 6/10 | Ranking/vocabulary and missing section introductions remain measurable failures |
| [C01–C10 ablation](experiments/cytiva-contaminants-context-results.md) | Baseline 6/10, vocabulary 7/10, section 10/10, combined 10/10; section/combined maximum 2,027 tokens | Context of section explains most gain; combined saves 20.35 mean tokens versus section-only in this sample |
| [Frozen H01-H10 section-only run](../experiments/cytiva/reviewed-section-evaluation/README.md) | 8/10 intents complete in both languages (EN 9/10, FR 8/10) | Gate blocked; later inspected failures became development inputs |
| [Frozen v03b / V01-V12](../experiments/cytiva/reviewed-v03b-evaluation/README.md) | 6/12 complete in both languages, but only 3/12 also respect explicit scope; all 24 contexts retained | Merged blocked result; no source leakage, but omissions and unrequested phase context prevent promotion |
| [v04 development A-D](../experiments/cytiva/compositional-navigation-v04-results/README.md) | Final known-case evidence coverage V12/12, H10/10, C10/10 in both languages; V has zero unrequested/outside-acceptable context | Merged opt-in development variant after failure inspection, not an independent evaluation or default change; one optional V03 seed is still dropped at six seeds |
| Local W01-W12 preparation | Frozen v04 and twelve new EN/FR references with exact excerpts, expected answers, exclusions and diagnostics | Not merged, all references pending human review, no W retrieval results; same known pages 118-121 |

The original Q/N/C series contains 28 intents with paired FR/EN formulations,
not 56 independent observations. H and V add reviewed same-corpus challenges;
inspected failures subsequently informed development. Required-source presence
is not answer correctness, refusal quality or measured precision. Section-only
was the earlier ablation preference; v04 is now the separately frozen local W
candidate. The W package was authored with knowledge of the implementation and
prior failures, and is not a new-section/manual or blind benchmark.

On V, frozen v03b averaged 705.33 context tokens with a maximum of 1,187; final
v04 development averages 663.75 with a maximum of 1,220. Lower mean size does not
mean every context shrinks or every corpus improves. The later W source-only
feasibility check found a maximum required bundle of 1,109 tokens, without running
retrieval; this is not an observed W context size or performance result.

E118-I and E121-EQ remain pending and excluded from indexes and contexts,
including indirect dependencies. W10/W11 validation would approve only their
question/reference associations, not those sources. W09's pressure-absence claim
is restricted to the 25 eligible excerpts, never the full manual. W12 is a labelled
synthetic contradictory request, not manual content. No generated answer is
scored in these retrieval-only trials, and diagnostics do not certify refusal or
clarification quality. New rules remain experimental policy, not approval of
scientific applicability.

### Remaining product and reasoning requirements

Retrieve multiple candidates, preserve negations and distinguish multiple symptoms.
Ask for missing resin, phase or operating context before proposing conditional
procedures. Separate text relevance from diagnostic confidence. Index source
passages alongside graph facts; expose evidence to the user.

Adopt KAG principles: explicit ontology, concept alignment, graph-to-passage links,
and bounded rule evaluation. Start with a small set of expert-reviewed rules over
Neo4j and record premise IDs, rule version and derived conclusions. Unknown
conditions produce unknown/clarification, not an assumed truth.

Exit: independent held-out bilingual and adversarial cases covering near-domain
misses, contradictory manuals, negation, multiple symptoms, missing context,
invalid instructions and unsupported numerical claims. Compare with phase 0 on
accuracy, false acceptances, refusal quality, latency and cost.

### Candidate evaluation: LightRAG versus simpler retrieval

LightRAG is a candidate for evaluation, not an adopted dependency or a replacement
for the v0.2 contract, manual review, quarantine or Neo4j service graph. Follow the
[three-arm retrieval protocol](experiments/retrieval-comparison-protocol.md):
current lexical/graph retrieval family, simple passage retrieval, and LightRAG on
the same reviewed corpus and canonical passages. Keep the unchanged legacy app
as a separate coverage witness; do not rank its six-symptom seed directly against
a larger indexed manual.

First compare retrieval alone, then use a common answer model and validated
renderer only after the required adapters exist. Freeze questions, input hashes,
chunking, context budgets and configurations; measure evidence quality, refusal,
conditions/quantities, latency, tokens and RAM on the local PC. Use local models
with zero additional API spend. Compare chunking/extraction variants separately.
Only consider adoption if the measured gain over the simpler alternatives survives
resource, provenance and quarantine checks. The three-arm comparison and LightRAG
integration remain unexecuted. Existing
BM25 trials are a lexical baseline/ablation; they do not implement the protocol's
simple multilingual-vector arm or its common-corpus graph and LightRAG adapters.
Reconcile the separately tested six-hit candidate with the protocol's five-passage
limit by declaring and freezing one shared comparison policy before measurement.

## Phase 5 — Decide whether an OpenSPG KAG experiment is justified

Only if representative tasks require multi-hop reasoning beyond the bounded
Neo4j approach, run an isolated OpenSPG KAG comparison on the same held-out set,
sources and model budget. Include indexing/operations cost and evidence quality.
Do not replace the production store unless the measured gain justifies migration.
Neither a graph nor KAG guarantees absence of hallucinations or GxP suitability.

## Design decisions from the observability/provenance discussion (2026-10-17)

These are design requirements, not integrations implemented in phase 0.

### Portable tracing

Instrument application boundaries with the OpenTelemetry SDK, export OTLP to an
OpenTelemetry Collector, and configure backend exporters independently. Use GenAI
semantic conventions pinned to a documented version plus a small bioprocess.*
namespace. Keep backend-specific mappings in collector configuration or an adapter.
Prove portability by sending one fixture trace to two backends and checking parent
links, timings, errors, usage and retrieval metadata. Transport compatibility does
not guarantee equivalent dashboards, evaluation storage or price calculations.

Record graph/document snapshots, model/prompt/schema versions and immutable result
references. Keep large source payloads in controlled artifact storage rather than
span attributes. Export metadata only by default; full-context capture is explicit.

### Ragas and adversarial evaluation

Use Ragas alongside deterministic contracts, with explicitly configured judge and
embedding providers (local for offline mode). Serialize graph evidence into source
contexts while retaining IDs. Evaluate answer relevance, context usefulness and
reference-based correctness; do not rely on final-text faithfulness alone, since
our renderer already reproduces graph facts. Extend evaluations to PDF-to-claim
fidelity and relation direction. Judge scores are not manual approval.

Use Promptfoo as the initial red-team harness against the complete application,
with generation, grading and any embedding calls configured locally for offline
runs. Add direct and document-borne injection, fake citations, wrong resin/operation,
negation, unit changes, missing conditions and budget-exhaustion cases. Keep a
balanced benign set to detect an always-refuse regression. Use deterministic
checks for schema/IDs/sources/budgets and calibrated judges for semantic errors.
Store minimal attack fixtures and regression outcomes, not unreviewed malicious
content in the published graph. Garak is an optional second tool for model-level
probes, not an additional mandatory dependency.

### Claim-level evidence contract

Docling Graph's detailed provenance is a starting point. Its verbatim match can
locate an entity identifier without proving every property or relation. Preserve
the full provenance ledger and distinguish exact, approximate and unresolved
anchors. Build an application Evidence record for every atomic claim, including
relations and numerical properties:

- immutable PDF SHA-256 and document version;
- conversion, extraction schema/model and chunking configuration versions;
- PDF page index (explicitly zero-based) and optional printed page label;
- Docling item references and geometry with coordinate-system metadata;
- exact source quote, text hash and offsets into an immutable text artifact;
- table/row/column/footnote references when applicable;
- subject, predicate, object/value/unit, polarity and applicability conditions;
- explicit source statement vs derived interpretation;
- localization check, semantic judge verdict, manual review and reviewer/date.

Code resolves artifact IDs to registered paths (never arbitrary model-supplied
filesystem paths). Deterministic checks verify file identity, page/item existence,
quote/span alignment and supported numeric/unit conversions. A text match proves
location, not general semantic entailment. An optional judge reads only the cited
passages plus required headers/notes and returns supported / contradicted /
insufficient, with evidence IDs. Publication remains manually reviewed. Never
upgrade approximate anchors or judge scores to manual approval.

Provide a review screen linking each claim/relation to highlighted PDF passages,
with approve/reject/edit actions and an append-only review record. The user can
validate documentary fidelity even without access to a domain expert; that is
not the same as validating a procedure for a particular industrial process.

### Chunking experiments

Separate extraction windows from retrieval/evidence units. Start with Docling's
structural chunks and preserve heading trails, product/resin scope, warnings,
footnotes, table headers and continuation links. An extraction unit should keep a
troubleshooting row (symptom, cause, remedy) together. Split oversized tables by
rows with repeated headers/context; do not cut a value away from its unit or note.
Cross-page sections may stay together while retaining exact per-item page anchors.

Compare structural section/row windows against the whole small document baseline
and bounded token-budget windows (initial experimental values: 600/1000/1400,
counted with the actual model tokenizer). These values are hypotheses, not chosen
optima. Overlap should repeat required context, not indiscriminately copy text.
Deduplicate by evidence identity. Compare missing relations, incorrect cross-row
links, numeric errors, provenance quality, review effort, latency and tokens.

### Latency and local inference experiments

The current query is fixed parameterized Cypher, not LLM-generated Cypher. Trace
cold-start/connection time, database execution and fetch, each LLM call and retry,
serialization size, and rendering independently. Neo4j does not consume LLM tokens;
resubmitting graph results to the model does. Benchmark warm and cold separately.

Compare the current loop with: (a) deterministic bilingual symptom selection;
(b) one constrained local classification/extraction call followed by a parameterized
query and deterministic rendering, without returning long graph descriptions to
the model; (c) the existing hosted model baseline. Preserve negation and scope
checks and evaluate false acceptance before adopting a faster route.

For a small static dataset, compare an immutable JSON adjacency map or SQLite FTS
snapshot with Neo4j. Include snapshot/version consistency and publication updates;
retain Neo4j unless measured benefits justify another serving representation.

Start local model trials with Ministral-3-3B-Instruct-2512 GGUF Q4_K_M; compare
Qwen3.5-4B with thinking disabled for short structured tasks. Pin exact artifacts
and runtimes. No fine-tuning until held-out errors show a stable learnable problem;
fine-tune routing/extraction format, not mutable handbook facts. Hardware fit and
answering latency remain to be benchmarked on the known reference PC: Intel
i5-1135G7 (4 cores/8 threads), 16 GB RAM and Intel Iris Xe, without a CUDA GPU.
The earlier 56-minute extraction does not measure interactive answering latency.

### Visualization and portfolio deliverables

Use Neo4j Browser/Query for instances and schema exploration. Use local Protege
only if an explicit OWL ontology adds value; an observed Neo4j schema is not a
formal ontology. Initially document allowed types, predicates and constraints in
a versioned schema rather than maintaining unnecessary duplicate representations.

Portfolio evidence: reproducible local startup, reviewed source-linked examples,
held-out evaluation and red-team reports, measured cost/latency comparisons,
portable telemetry export, a brief demo, and candid limitations. CI is a future
proposal, not an instruction to publish or bypass user validation.

## Implementation update: first ingestion/review slice

Implemented an isolated, pinned Docling Graph dense adapter using native hybrid
chunking and detailed provenance, Pydantic entity/relation templates, immutable
source/conversion/ledger artifacts, deterministic quote localization, manual
approve/reject decisions, correction into a new run, and approved snapshot export.
A loopback UI displays extracted passages and PDFium-rendered source pages.
Optional parameterized Neo4j publication creates a separate reviewed evidence
snapshot; the chatbot's existing graph is not automatically enriched.

Initial validation covered synthetic fixtures and the upstream configuration
contract. Subsequent real-manual conversion/chunking reviews and passage-retrieval
experiments are summarized above; the initial local extraction's limitations are
retained in [its diagnostic](experiments/cytiva-local-extraction-diagnostic.md).
Selected table repairs and conservation checks do not complete phase 3 extraction
precision/recall, lifecycle or publication acceptance. Ragas, OpenTelemetry,
Promptfoo execution and the reviewed-record serving adapter remain unimplemented.
See [INGESTION.md](INGESTION.md) for local commands and route-specific limitations.
