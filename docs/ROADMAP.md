# Roadmap for evidence-grounded bioprocess assistance

Help bioprocess engineers inspect source-backed troubleshooting guidance.
Keep source review, documentary previews, and operational decisions separate.

## What works today

| Area | Available now |
| --- | --- |
| Graph chat | Anthropic selects curated Neo4j results. Chainlit validates those selections and displays the facts and citations. [Grounding decision](ADR-001-knowledge-graph-grounding.md) |
| Local demo | Guided and bounded English and French requests use reviewed Cytiva excerpts. The Windows setup has same-PC evidence. [Demo guide](DEMO-FIRST.md) |
| MabSelect | The guided Chainlit mode uses an approved local registry. Citations and withdrawal checks follow the current registry authority. [Operator guide](CHAINLIT-MABSELECT.md) |
| Protein A/G Sepharose | The merged candidate provides a separate Chainlit preview with scoped sources, clarification, and simulated withdrawals. Release v03 was verified in one approved local installation. The public recording shows the preview; it does not provide access to that installation. [Candidate guide](CHAINLIT-SEPHAROSE-CANDIDATE.md) · [PR #91](https://github.com/mukunde/bioprocess-assistant/pull/91) |
| Evidence preparation | Local Docling Graph extraction and a separate reviewed model extraction have produced development evidence. [Ingestion guide](INGESTION.md) · [Reviewed extraction](../experiments/cytiva/reviewed-r2/README.md) |
| Observability | Graph chat has opt-in local OpenTelemetry traces for request, Anthropic, and Neo4j latency, plus reported tokens and estimated model cost. The registry UI has its own local metadata traces and read-only summary. [Graph chat traces](LOCAL-GRAPH-CHAT.md#optional-local-traces) · [Registry trace demo](REGISTRY-TRACE-DEMO.md) |

The [README thumbnail](../README.md#watch-the-demo) opens the
[1080p graph chat demo](https://mukunde.github.io/bioprocess-assistant/graph-chat/).
Browser verification confirmed that the 27-second video plays inline at
1920 × 1080 without signing in or downloading the file.
[Pages deployment](https://github.com/mukunde/bioprocess-assistant/actions/runs/42224594186)

The [Chainlit Sepharose recording](https://mukunde.github.io/bioprocess-assistant/sepharose/)
remains available separately.

and the [history of this roadmap through 5 November 2026](https://github.com/mukunde/bioprocess-assistant/blob/6be6ce24ce7e0da547a93de9042826dc3cbe818a/docs/ROADMAP.md).

## Next priority

Establish a measured baseline for the model-backed graph chat. Define a
reviewed question set and a spending cap before running live requests.
Include a sourced answer, an unsupported request, and a simulated retrieval
failure. Wait for local tracing to initialize before measuring.

Check citation fidelity and abstention. Summarize request and stage latency,
reported tokens, and estimated cost. Report trace coverage and note that
Anthropic SDK retries contribute to latency without separate usage records.

## Follow-up work

| Work | When it is ready to advance |
| --- | --- |
| Windows portability | Run the pinned protocol on a second physical PC and record the mandatory checks and any retries. [Second-PC protocol](validation/WINDOWS-SECOND-PC.md) |
| Independent acceptance | Define a held-out set for new evidence or behavior. Cover missing context, conflicting sources, negation, and unsupported quantities. Record false acceptances, abstentions, latency, and cost. [Evaluation guide](../eval/README.md) |
| Wider model observability | After the chat baseline, apply the same metadata and budget rules to extraction and judge calls. [Tracing guide](REGISTRY-TRACING.md) |
| Generated-answer evaluation | Calibrate Ragas judges and run Promptfoo attacks with benign controls once the corresponding answering path is in scope. |
| Evidence publication | Measure extraction precision and recall on annotated claims. Check source identity, quotations, quantities, and applicability. Exercise review, idempotent import, and rollback before publishing claims to Neo4j. [Claim contract](CLAIM-CONTRACT-V02.md) · [Ingestion guide](INGESTION.md) |
| Retrieval comparison | Compare graph retrieval, passage retrieval, and LightRAG on the same reviewed corpus, inputs, and budget. Measure evidence quality and resource use before choosing a serving approach. [Three-arm protocol](experiments/retrieval-comparison-protocol.md) |

Consider OpenSPG KAG only if measured reasoning failures justify a separate
comparison. Consider fine-tuning only after an evaluation identifies a gap it
could address. Reopen document conversion when a new format, a required source,
or a measured failure calls for it.

## Scope of validation

The current evidence supports bounded documentary and software checks.
Operational use requires separate scientific validation and approval.
